*I used DOMcontentloaded event listener to load the html before JS code (got this idea from somewhere else, 
	as I didn't study it yet or find it in the course program).
*const getdata to execute the search after clicking on the search button.
*const movieinput is for the area where the search is done.
*const moviename is the constant value that's typed in the search field.
*const movie is the function that retrieves the movie name based on the input.

*document.getelementbyID("id").textContent to show the result in the HTML.
*.catch to show code errors on the console.log().
